        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>I am currently a <b>software engineer for Google</b> based out of <b>Seattle, WA.</b> I am particularly interested in fintech applications including algorithmic and high-frequency trading. I love reading about different derivative trading strategies and computational models that govern most of our largest financial markets.</p>

        <p>I spend a lot of my time hiking, sampling ciders from all accross the US and discussing philosophy. Follow my adventures on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/abhaydalmiaa/" target="_blank">@abhaydalmiaa</a>. I also love great writing and I'm always looking for recommendations.</p>
