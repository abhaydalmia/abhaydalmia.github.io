        <h3>Mechanical Engineering Research</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Pitot Tube and Thermal Anemometer:</b> The purpose of this investigation was to characterize air flow through a restriction using a pitot-static probe and thermal anemometer. This was done by measuring the velocity in the axial and transverse directions and the turbulent intensity in the transverse direction. Can be viewed <a class="one" href="papers/ME4056/pitot.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Forced Convection:</b> The objective of the investigation was to determine the convection coefficient for a series of air flow velocities onto a copper cylinder by observing the ambient temperature of the wind tunnel and the surface temperature of the copper cylinder with thermocouples under the range of air velocities. The convection coefficient result was compared to literature and developed into a model to determine the convection coefficient empirically. The uncertainties of the experimental convection coefficient and the empirical model were calculated. Essentially, the relationship between convection coefficient and velocity fluctuation was investigated.

        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Blackbody Radiation:</b> The objective of the investigation was to verify the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which is the governing equation for radiative heat transfer, by observing the change in net radiative heat transfer between two blackbodies and comparing calculated theoretical values to measured results. The blackbodies were subject to varying temperatures, diameters, and distance between them. Can be viewed <a class="one" href="papers/ME4056/blackbodyradiation.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Vapor Pressure:</b> The objective of the lab was to determine the enthalpy of vaporization, for refrigerant R-134a at 45ÂºC. The enthalpy was determined by observing the relationship between temperature and pressure of R-134a, determining the specific volume of the R-134a vessel, and applying the data and results to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation requires the refrigerant to be a saturated mixture, so the quality of R-134a was also determined at every data point.

        <h3>Investigation of the change in viscosity of a liquid with change in its temperature.<br><small>Abhay Dalmia | March 2014</small></h3>

        <p>This paper carried out an investigation into the change in viscosity of different fluids as a function of the change in temperature, by considering the terminal velocity of a falling sphere. The relationship is determined by carrying out force balances on the sphere, travelling at terminal velocity in the liquid. Stokes' Law, turbulence, buoyancy and gravity are used to estimate the corresponding viscosity of the liquid.</p>

        <p>This investigation has shown evidence that the terminal velocity of the sphere falling through the liquid increases cubically with the absolute temperature. Additionally, the natural log of terminal velocity increases linearly with inverse of temperature. Viscosity decreases cubically with temperature. Additionally, the natural log of viscosity varies linearly with the inverse of temperature. Finally, this investigation shows that viscosity decreases with temperature as terminal velocity increases with temperature.</p>

        <p>This investigation was carried out as part of the <a class="two" href="http://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/" target="_blank">IB Diploma Programme</a> and under the guidance of Mr. Gajendra Singh Rawat.

        <h3>Dynamical analysis of trajectory and kinematics of a rocket propelled bicycle.<br><small>Abhay Dalmia | November 2015</small></h3>

        <p>The aim of this paper was to model the exact trajectory of an experiment conducted in on November 7, 2014 in Switzerland where a rocket propelled bicycle reached a top speed of 92.5 m/s. Video can be watched <a class="one" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WREyAicJXkM" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The experiment provides key kinematics data of the bicycle's trajectory (including the bicycle's speed and acceleation at key points of the journey. Using this information, the paper used key assumptions and numerical methods to model the thrust provided by the rockets, the complete velocity and acceleration profile of the bicycle and all other kinematic constraints of the experiment.</p>

        <p>This investigation was carried out as part of <a class="two" href="http://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a> coursework under the guidance of <a class="two" href="https://pe.gatech.edu/instructors/apinut-sirirojvisuth-phd" target="_blank">Dr. Apinut Sirirojvisuth</a>.

        <h3>Pipe mechanics for Dunetown using numerical methods.<br><small>Abhay Dalmia | July 2015</small></h3>

        <p>This paper calculates the minimum pipe diameter required to deliver a water flow rate of atleast 10,000 gallons per minute to Dunetown (fictitious town for the purposes of this investogation.)</p>

        <p>The Bernoulli's Principle provides the backing analysis of this fluid mechanical system. Head loss, and fricition factors for turbulent and laminar flow, and the Reynolds' Number are also factored in to ocmputer the minimum pipe diameter requrired. This equations are solved using numerous numerical methods (in MATLAB), including several root finding algorithms.</p>
